# Technologies of 21<sup>st</sup Century

---

Playing lots of modpacks, I was inspired of idea creating modpack like it would has GregTech 4.5. I set up crafts, like I would see GregTech 4.5. I tried to set up normal mode. Normal mode in other modpack is usually unchanged and unconfigured mode. In my modpack normal mode is like hard one in other modpacks. Also, this pack was desinged for people, who played only 1.7.10 (and lower) version modpack and don't know new tech mods.

This repository contains CraftTweaker scripts, custom assets and mods' configurations of the modpack.
